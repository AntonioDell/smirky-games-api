# smirky-games-api

Straight forward, simple backend for basic needs of the [smirky-games-website](https://smirky-games.com). Feel free to use any code you like from this project and to ask any question you like in the [issues section](https://github.com/AntonioDell/smirky-games-api/issues) :)
We use [Deno](https://deno.land/) as main framework and [PixiJS](https://pixijs.io/) for more complicated stuff, like mini-games.
Follow the development on our [Trello-Board](https://trello.com/b/igRqIVRv/smirkygames-website).
