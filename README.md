# smirky-games-api

Straight forward, simple backend for basic needs of the [smirky-games-website](https://smirky-games.com). Feel free to use any code you like from this project and to ask any question you like in the [issues section](https://github.com/AntonioDell/smirky-games-api/issues) :)
We use [Deno](https://deno.land/) as runtime, pm2 as process manager on the server and nginx as reverse proxy.

## Deployment
Run the [deploy.sh](scripts/deploy.sh) with the username as first command line argument to deploy the files to the server. You need to have a ssh certificate installed and used by the ssh-agent in order for the ssh connection to succeed.
